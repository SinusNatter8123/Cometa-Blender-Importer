# Cometa-Blender-Importer
A way of showing the cometa-IMU-Sensor Data in Blender
## Usage
Just paste the contents of the ``CometaImporter.py`` to your Blender Scripting Environment and add your configuration. My ``examole_config_data.py`` has the dictionaries that worked for my usecase. But you can also create your own and use the armature-bone-names of your rig. I used the ``Y-Bot.fbx`` Model.
